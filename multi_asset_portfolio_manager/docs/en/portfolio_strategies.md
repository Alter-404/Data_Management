# Portfolio Strategies

This document provides detailed information about the portfolio strategies implemented in the Multi-Asset Portfolio Manager project. Each strategy has different characteristics, risk profiles, and optimization methods.

## Overview

The portfolio strategies in this system are designed to create diversified portfolios with different risk-return profiles. Each strategy implements different algorithms for asset selection, weighting, and rebalancing.

All strategies implement the abstract `PortfolioStrategy` base class, which defines the following interface:

```python
class PortfolioStrategy(ABC):
    def __init__(self, risk_profile):
        self.risk_profile = risk_profile
        
    @abstractmethod
    def generate_signals(self, market_data, portfolio_data):
        pass
        
    def train(self, market_data, portfolio_data):
        pass
        
    def rebalance(self, current_positions, new_signals):
        pass
```

## Low Risk Strategy

### Purpose

The Low Risk strategy aims to create a portfolio with minimal volatility while maintaining acceptable returns. This strategy is suitable for conservative investors who prioritize capital preservation over high returns.

### Algorithm

The Low Risk strategy uses the Minimum Variance Portfolio (MVP) approach, which minimizes the portfolio variance by solving the following optimization problem:

minimize: w^T Σ w
subject to: sum(w) = 1, w ≥ 0

Where:
- w is the vector of portfolio weights
- Σ is the covariance matrix of asset returns

### Implementation Details

```python
class LowRiskStrategy(PortfolioStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Low Risk")
        self.lookback_period = 252  # 1 year of trading days
        self.max_position_size = 0.15  # Maximum allocation to any single asset
        
    def train(self, market_data, portfolio_data):
        # Calculate return series for all assets
        returns = self._calculate_returns(market_data)
        
        # Calculate covariance matrix using exponential weighting
        self.cov_matrix = self._calculate_covariance_matrix(returns)
        
    def generate_signals(self, market_data, portfolio_data):
        if not hasattr(self, 'cov_matrix'):
            self.train(market_data, portfolio_data)
            
        # Set up optimization problem
        num_assets = len(self.asset_symbols)
        constraints = [
            {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: np.sum(w) - 1},  # Weights sum to 1
            {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda w: w}  # Weights >= 0
        ]
        
        # Add constraint for maximum position size
        for i in range(num_assets):
            constraints.append(
                {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda w, i=i: self.max_position_size - w[i]}
            )
            
        # Define objective function (portfolio variance)
        def objective(weights):
            return weights.T @ self.cov_matrix @ weights
            
        # Initial guess: equal weights
        initial_weights = np.ones(num_assets) / num_assets
        
        # Solve optimization problem
        result = minimize(objective, initial_weights, constraints=constraints, method='SLSQP')
        
        # Create dictionary of asset weights
        weights = dict(zip(self.asset_symbols, result.x))
        return weights
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Expected Volatility**: Low (5-8% annualized)
- **Expected Return**: Moderate (6-10% annualized)
- **Max Drawdown Target**: < 15%
- **Sharpe Ratio Target**: 0.8-1.2
- **Turnover**: Low to medium (20-40% annually)

## Low Turnover Strategy

### Purpose

The Low Turnover strategy aims to minimize trading costs by reducing portfolio turnover while maintaining a balance between risk and return. This strategy is suitable for investors who want to minimize transaction costs and tax implications.

### Algorithm

The Low Turnover strategy uses a combination of mean-variance optimization with a penalty for portfolio changes. The optimization problem is:

minimize: w^T Σ w - λ₁ μ^T w + λ₂ ||w - w_prev||²
subject to: sum(w) = 1, w ≥ 0

Where:
- w is the vector of new portfolio weights
- w_prev is the vector of current portfolio weights
- Σ is the covariance matrix of asset returns
- μ is the vector of expected returns
- λ₁ is the risk aversion parameter
- λ₂ is the turnover penalty parameter

### Implementation Details

```python
class LowTurnoverStrategy(PortfolioStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("Low Turnover")
        self.lookback_period = 252  # 1 year of trading days
        self.risk_aversion = 2.0  # Risk aversion parameter
        self.turnover_penalty = 5.0  # Penalty for changes in weights
        self.max_position_size = 0.20  # Maximum allocation to any single asset
        
    def train(self, market_data, portfolio_data):
        # Calculate return series for all assets
        returns = self._calculate_returns(market_data)
        
        # Calculate covariance matrix
        self.cov_matrix = self._calculate_covariance_matrix(returns)
        
        # Calculate expected returns (using historical mean as a simple estimate)
        self.expected_returns = returns.mean(axis=0)
        
    def generate_signals(self, market_data, portfolio_data):
        if not hasattr(self, 'cov_matrix'):
            self.train(market_data, portfolio_data)
            
        # Get current portfolio weights
        current_weights = self._get_current_weights(portfolio_data)
        
        # Set up optimization problem
        num_assets = len(self.asset_symbols)
        constraints = [
            {'type': 'eq', 'fun': lambda w: np.sum(w) - 1},  # Weights sum to 1
            {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda w: w}  # Weights >= 0
        ]
        
        # Add constraint for maximum position size
        for i in range(num_assets):
            constraints.append(
                {'type': 'ineq', 'fun': lambda w, i=i: self.max_position_size - w[i]}
            )
            
        # Define objective function with turnover penalty
        def objective(weights):
            portfolio_variance = weights.T @ self.cov_matrix @ weights
            expected_return = weights.T @ self.expected_returns
            turnover_cost = np.sum((weights - current_weights)**2)
            
            return portfolio_variance - self.risk_aversion * expected_return + self.turnover_penalty * turnover_cost
            
        # Initial guess: current weights or equal weights if no current weights
        initial_weights = current_weights if len(current_weights) > 0 else np.ones(num_assets) / num_assets
        
        # Solve optimization problem
        result = minimize(objective, initial_weights, constraints=constraints, method='SLSQP')
        
        # Create dictionary of asset weights
        weights = dict(zip(self.asset_symbols, result.x))
        return weights
```

### Performance Characteristics

- **Expected Volatility**: Medium (8-12% annualized)
- **Expected Return**: Medium (8-12% annualized)
- **Max Drawdown Target**: < 20%
- **Sharpe Ratio Target**: 0.7-1.0
- **Turnover**: Very low (10-20% annually)

## High Yield Equity Strategy

### Purpose

The High Yield Equity strategy aims to maximize dividend income and total return by investing in high-dividend-yielding stocks. This strategy is suitable for income-focused investors who want regular cash flow from their investments.

### Algorithm

The High Yield Equity strategy uses a multi-factor approach to select and weight assets based on:
1. Dividend yield (higher is better)
2. Dividend growth rate (higher is better)
3. Dividend payout ratio (lower is better, for sustainability)
4. Historical volatility (lower is better)

The selection process involves:
1. Ranking assets by a combined score of the above factors
2. Selecting the top N assets
3. Weighting them based on their scores with adjustments for diversification

### Implementation Details

```python
class HighYieldEquityStrategy(PortfolioStrategy):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__("High Yield Equity")
        self.lookback_period = 252  # 1 year of trading days
        self.num_assets_to_select = 20  # Number of assets to include in portfolio
        self.max_position_size = 0.10  # Maximum allocation to any single asset
        
    def train(self, market_data, portfolio_data):
        # Calculate return series for all assets
        returns = self._calculate_returns(market_data)
        
        # Calculate volatility for all assets
        self.volatilities = returns.std(axis=0) * np.sqrt(252)  # Annualized
        
        # In a real implementation, we would fetch dividend data
        # For simulation, we'll use mock dividend data
        self.dividend_yield = self._get_dividend_data('yield')
        self.dividend_growth = self._get_dividend_data('growth')
        self.payout_ratio = self._get_dividend_data('payout')
        
    def generate_signals(self, market_data, portfolio_data):
        if not hasattr(self, 'volatilities'):
            self.train(market_data, portfolio_data)
            
        # Calculate combined score for each asset
        scores = {}
        for symbol in self.asset_symbols:
            # Normalize each factor to 0-1 range
            yield_score = self._normalize(self.dividend_yield[symbol], is_higher_better=True)
            growth_score = self._normalize(self.dividend_growth[symbol], is_higher_better=True)
            payout_score = self._normalize(self.payout_ratio[symbol], is_higher_better=False)
            vol_score = self._normalize(self.volatilities[symbol], is_higher_better=False)
            
            # Combined score with factor weights
            scores[symbol] = 0.4 * yield_score + 0.3 * growth_score + 0.15 * payout_score + 0.15 * vol_score
            
        # Select top N assets based on scores
        selected_symbols = sorted(scores.keys(), key=lambda x: scores[x], reverse=True)[:self.num_assets_to_select]
        
        # Weight assets based on scores
        total_score = sum(scores[symbol] for symbol in selected_symbols)
        weights = {symbol: scores[symbol] / total_score for symbol in selected_symbols}
        
        # Ensure no weight exceeds maximum position size
        max_weight = max(weights.values())
        if max_weight > self.max_position_size:
            # Scale down weights
            scaling_factor = self.max_position_size / max_weight
            weights = {symbol: weight * scaling_factor for symbol, weight in weights.items()}
            
            # Redistribute excess weight
            excess_weight = 1.0 - sum(weights.values())
            if excess_weight > 0:
                for symbol in weights:
                    weights[symbol] += excess_weight / len(weights)
                    
        return weights
```

## Extending the Strategy Framework

New strategies can be implemented by creating a new class that inherits from the `PortfolioStrategy` base class. The key methods to implement are:

1. `train()`: Analyzes historical data to prepare for signal generation.
2. `generate_signals()`: Produces portfolio weights based on market data and current portfolio.

Optional methods to override:

3. `rebalance()`: Defines how to transition from current positions to target positions.
4. `_calculate_returns()`: Customizes how returns are calculated from price data.
5. `_calculate_covariance_matrix()`: Customizes the covariance estimation method.

## Constraints and Parameters

Each strategy supports various constraints and parameters that can be adjusted:

- **Risk Profile**: Determines the overall risk preference of the strategy.
- **Max Position Size**: Limits the maximum allocation to any single asset.
- **Min Position Size**: Sets the minimum allocation for an included asset.
- **Sector Constraints**: Limits exposure to specific sectors.
- **Asset Class Constraints**: Controls allocation across different asset classes.
- **Turnover Constraints**: Limits how much the portfolio can change in each rebalance.
- **Lookback Period**: Determines how much historical data is used for calculations.

These constraints can be passed as a dictionary to the strategy's constructor or to the `generate_signals()` method.
